Algorithm Analysis
Studying Algorithm Analysis equipped me with the ability to evaluate the efficiency and performance of algorithms, a crucial skill for developing software that runs efficiently and conserves computational resources. Secondly, it enhanced my problem-solving capabilities by teaching me how to break down complex problems into manageable components and design efficient algorithms to address them. Lastly, this module deepened my understanding of algorithm design techniques, such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms, which are essential for creating optimized solutions in various fields, from computer science to data science and engineering.
